The .py files are automatically created by running, on the command line,
miller.py with a rml filename as the first argument.

One could also run parsers/rmlparser.py on the command line with a rml filename
as the first argument.

You should set your PYTHONPATH to the repo root directory, and run these scripts
from the root, as well.

    $ export PYTHONPATH=./
    $ python parsers/rmlparser.py input_files/foo.rml
    $ python input_files/foo.py

 Note that the above commands are equivalent to the following:
 	
     $ python miller.py input_files/fool.rml
