==== INSTALLATION ====

1. Pull from github
    http://github.com/diN0bot/miller/tree/master
    
2. Optional: Override global default_settings.py with local,
   non-version controlled settings.py
   
   1. Create new file called settings.py
   2. Override variables defined in default_settings.py in settings.py
   
   Edit settings.py as necessary. settings.py is "git ignored",
